## Improvements (Dev)
- Global CSS file + page specific CSS files
- HTML and CSS responsive page :)
- Adding more fishes into the background
- Edit task
- Improving aesthetics
- User friendly elements:
   - After you book the date, it gets deleted from your list
   - Adding an invite/join feature
- Also made the mistake of making html/css design edits at 80% view rather than default 100%

## Improvements (Prod)
- It's super slow and I'm not too sure why 



## Extensions
- incorporating GPT/AI wrapper to generate date itineraries based on the dates that have been uplodade

## Takeaways
- Project learnings:
  - Sticking to deadlines
  - Designing first
  - Be clear and focussed on the purpose
  - Challenging yourself the "right way"
  - Be aware of the big picture
  - If you're stressed really think about why? Could be an indicator you're not doing what your supposed to be or you're doing it in the wrong way?
    
- Wider Codings To Do
  - Experiment with more/different kinds of learning techniques (build this up --> methods that suit you)
  - Research more into different kinds of projects and whatnot to build
 
- What's next?
  - Koii - social media algo
  - Using an OpenAI wrapper to solve some kind of issue of mine
  - Some kind of OOP/comp sci vision/company related project?
  - Or focus on job recruiting?
